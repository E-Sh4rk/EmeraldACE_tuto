# Freezer bad egg

The *freezer bad egg* is a bad egg that can be used to run any piece of code each frame. It can be used, among other things, to *freeze* the value of a memory address.

## Prerequisite

- An ACE glitch species (for instance 0x40E9 for english version)
- If you use a glitch species that executes Thumb code such as 0x40E9, you will also need a Thumb->ARM bootstrap
- A [certificate exit code bootstrap](exit-code.md) (you can place it in the first slot of BOX 14 for instance). Note that it does not matter if you have renamed your BOX 14 as the creation of this bad egg uses the hexadecimal-writer bad egg
- The [hexadecimal-writer and crafting table bad eggs](hex-writer.md)
